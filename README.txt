The current mobile extension has the following features:

1. Detects various mobile devices. Thanks to detectmobilebrowser.com for the list of devices.
2. Set a separate Templavoila template for mobile version just like how a templavoila print version works
3. Ability to automatically redirect to a separate mobile version of site: ex: www.example.mobi / mobile.example.com
4. When redirection is used it would also be able to switch back to normal site, using an extra query string variable
	ex: ?goMobile=false
5. Remembers the user's choice, thus avoiding redirection/use of URL parameter for each page visits.
6. Auto-redirect to a pre-specified page id
